# Perform a Magic Trick

Using the ARKit that is newly added to Xcode, I have created a magic hat that is capable of catching white balls and making them disappear with the touch of your finger.

To launch this project, do the follow:

1. Download the repository
2. Start the xcode project, by opening the MagicTrick.xcodeproj
3. Once open, make sure your phone is connected and make sure that once you hit the play button that it has your device that will be using the code.
4. The code should then load onto your device and voil√†! you can now play Magic Trick on your phone.

Here is an example of the project code below:
